# we need to write a slightly unusual program to demonstrate
# this, but let's do it!

# Program 1 (the first one) writes five 30,000 character lines
# Program 2 reads one line at a time, and after each line pauses for a second

# Because our pipe's buffer is only about 64KB, Program 1
# can't write all of its lines immediately: it has to wait to
# print lines 3 and 4. So it pauses, even though if there
# weren't a pipe it would  be able to print out all of its
# output right away and exit

# python -c lets you pass in a script for Python to run
